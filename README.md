In this folder, there will be added the algorithm projects carried out during the second year of our Fullstack specialization at holberton school. Theses are algorithm projects in order to be prepared for technicals interview.

## 1 - Lockboxes:
You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.
Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened. (python)

## 2- Insert_in_sorted_linked_list:
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

    - **Prototype**: `listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number)`;  
    - **Return**:  the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
  
## 3- Heap Insert:
Write a function in C that creates a binary tree node:

    - **Prototype**: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value)`;  
    - **Return**:  `a pointer to the new node, or NULL if it failed`;

Write a function in C that inserts a value into a Max Binary Heap:

    - **Prototype**: `heap_t *heap_insert(heap_t **root, int value)`;  
    - **Return**:  `the address of the inserted node, or NULL if it failed`;

## 4- Minimum operations:
In a text file, there is a single character H. Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file. Be smart about how you utilize the memory! (python)
